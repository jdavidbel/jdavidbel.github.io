## Teaching : 
I am teaching assistant in courses offered by the Department of Mathematics at The University of Iowa. I'm responsible to lead discussion sections that are intented to complement
the weekly lectures that students attend. During the discussion sections important concepts are reviewed,
students work in groups to discuss and solve problems related to the topics of their courses and they have the opportunity to ask for clarifications and
guidance to complete their assignments.
