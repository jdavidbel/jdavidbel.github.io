My name is José David Beltrán Lizarazo. 
I am a first year PhD student in Mathematics at [The University of Iowa](https://math.uiowa.edu/) where I also work as a teaching assistant. I'm mainly interested in Partial Differential Equations, more precisely hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. I'm currently working under the guidance of [Professor Tong Li](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~tli/). Previously I was a master student in Mathematics at the National University of Colombia, Bogotá. 
My thesis was related to weak convergence methods applied to non-linear hyperbolic conservation laws. I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Leonardo Rendón Arbelaez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5U0ZQxcAAAAJ&hl=es). 
I did my undergradute studies in Mathematics at the "Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas" in Bogotá, Colombia under the mentory of [Professor Arturo Sanjuán Cuellar](https://comunidad.udistrital.edu.co/arturosanjuan/).
