My name is José David Beltrán Lizarazo. 
I am a freshman PhD student in Mathematics at [University of Iowa](https://math.uiowa.edu/) . I will begin my classes by August/2021. Previously I was a master student in Mathematics at the National University of Colombia, Bogotá. 
My thesis was related to weak convergence methods applied to non-linear hyperbolic conservation laws. I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Leonardo Rendón Arbelaez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5U0ZQxcAAAAJ&hl=es). 
I did my undergradute studies in Mathematics at the "Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas" in Bogotá, Colombia under the mentory of [Professor Arturo Sanjuán Cuellar](https://comunidad.udistrital.edu.co/arturosanjuan/).
