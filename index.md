My name is José David Beltrán Lizarazo. 
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at [The University of Iowa](https://math.uiowa.edu/) where I also work as a teaching assistant. I'm mainly interested in partial differential equations, more precisely hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. I'm currently working under the guidance of [Professor Tong Li](https://math.uiowa.edu/people/tong-li).


I am originally from Bogotá-Colombia. I completed a MSc in Mathematics at the National University of Colombia, Bogotá under the supervision of [Prof. Leonardo Rendón Arbelaez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5U0ZQxcAAAAJ&hl=es). 
I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at the "Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas" in Bogotá, under the mentorship of [Professor Arturo Sanjuán Cuellar](https://comunidad.udistrital.edu.co/arturosanjuan/).
