My name is Alexander Leguizamón-Robayo. 
Currently, I am a master student of Mathematics at the National University of Colombia, Bogotá. 
My thesis is related to Jacobi structures and their symmetries under the supervision of [Prof.Nicolás Martínez Alba](https://sites.google.com/unal.edu.co/sem-interaccionesgeomfisica/organizadores/nicol%C3%A1s-mart%C3%ADnez?authuser=0) and [Prof. Daniele Sepe](https://sites.google.com/site/danielesepemaths/) at UFF. 

This semester I will be teaching differential equations for engineering undergraduates. [1000007-B Ecuaciones Diferenciales](/teaching/ecdif2020ii/).

I am also organizing a coding club for undergraduates of all disciplines (in Spanish).
We focus on self-learning, modern tools and techniques, and soft skills,  to build and implement mathematical models related to each of the members' interests.

Previously, I was a master student in Chemical Engineering at NTNU Trondheim under the supervision of [Prof. Sigurd Skogestad](https://folk.ntnu.no/skoge). I focused on process systems engineering, which is a mix of dynamical systems, control theory, optimisation, and computer science applied to practical problems (not necessarily related to the chemical industry).
